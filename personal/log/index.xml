      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my continued struggle to improve myself
I have decided to sign up for a coaching program
that the Kelley School of Business funds. I met with
my coach for the first time last night, and many of
the things we talked about were challenging. Hopefully
this document helps me stay on track with my goals for
the day and can serve as a starting place for the rest
of the week.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Summary of my February</title>

      <description>This last month was really hard. I got a paper rejected from a PLDI after getting really good reviews; My grandfather (fondly referred to as old man) passed on after spending the last 3 months of his life trapped in a nursing home; and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the internship that I applied for. Despite, all of this the last month has made me really hopeful. I have successfully lost 12ish pounds this year, maintained a reasonable exercise routine, taken over the majority of the cooking/shopping from my wife, and how found the energy to decide that I want to learn Japanese despite the fact that I really don&amp;rsquo;t have the time.</description>
