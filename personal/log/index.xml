      <description>This last month was really hard. I got a paper rejected from a vary prestigious conference after getting really good reviews; My grandfather (fondly referred to as oldman) passed on after spending the last 3 months of his life trapped in a nursing home; and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the internship that I applied for. Despite, all of this the last month has made me really hopeful. I have successfully lost 12ish pounds this year, maintained a reasonable exercise routine, taken over the majority of the cooking/shopping from my wife, and how found the energy to decide that I want to learn Japanese despite the fact that I really don&amp;rsquo;t have the time.</description>
