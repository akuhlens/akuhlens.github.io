Hi, I am Andre. I am a student of computer science, married man, cook,
cat owner, and fanboy of Japan. This is a personal site where I can
shout into the void and drone on ceaselessly about the things that
interest me outside of work.  If you want to know more about me
professionally please checkout my [professional page](/).
