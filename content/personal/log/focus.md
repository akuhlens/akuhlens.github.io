As part of my continued struggle to improve myself
I have decided to sign up for a coaching program
that the Kelley School of Business funds. I met with
my coach for the first time last night, and many of
the things we talked about were challenging. Hopefully
this document helps me stay on track with my goals for
the day and can serve as a starting place for the rest
of the week.

During our talk I decided that I am focusing on being
a more productive worker this week.
