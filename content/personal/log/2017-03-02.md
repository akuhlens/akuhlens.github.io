This last month was really hard. I got a paper rejected from a PLDI
after getting really good reviews; My grandfather (fondly referred to
as *old man*) passed on after spending the last 3 months of his life
trapped in a nursing home; and I didn't get the internship that I
applied for. Despite, all of this the last month has made me really
hopeful. I have successfully lost 12ish pounds this year, maintained a
reasonable exercise routine, taken over the majority of the
cooking/shopping from my wife, and how found the energy to decide that
I want to learn Japanese despite the fact that I really don't have the
time. I have a history of getting depressed easily, but I realized
this month that lately I have shown a lot of resilience, and I am
proud of that.

## Learning Japanese

Today I hope to memorize all of
(Hiragana)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana].  I have heard that
this can take upwards of 10 hours, but I am hoping to use much less
time because I have already memorized them once upon a time. Then
again I am pretty busy today so I won't be disappointed as long as I
get it done this weekend.
