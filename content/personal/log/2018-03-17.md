I am frustrated with a few things in life, but I am confused about if
they are things that should frustrate me or how to make them better.
<!--more-->



Some of the things that regularly stress me out are:
- My inability to keep up with my expectations for productivity at work. 
- and not being able to get to work on my personal goals.

These in turn make me respond to lessor stressors inappropriately.

- Like when I get frustrated at cars on the road that are probably 
  objectively driving just fine.
- Or when Laura (my wife) decides to stop what we are enjoying
  together to hang out with our roommate, which I was doing while
  cooking dinner, making desert, and cleaning the kitchen. Where
  cleaning the kitchen is her pre-agreed to responsibility which has
  been abandoned for the last week. Not to mention the fact that our
  sex life has been intermittently abandoned for the last 4 years.
  
I don't know how to calm down without bringing it up, but I also don't
think that any of this is actually rationally something I should be
stressing out over. I think that ultimately only by changing how I
think and react could I become immune to the poison that these issues
create in me.
