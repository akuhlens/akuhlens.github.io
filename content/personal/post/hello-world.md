This is my first blog post.

This site is generated using Hugo and hosted on Github.  It took me
longer than it should have figure out how to build this site, but I
think that is because I didn't know how to effectively debug Hugo
templates. I think that I have resolved this, and would love to share
what worked for me.

## Debugging Hugo Template

Work in progress...

- Adding a debug flag
- Figuring out which templates are being used

## Japanese Web Fonts

- How to pick fonts
- The state of Japanese web fonts  
  [Japanese webfonts](https://googlefonts.github.io/japanese/)

## Things I still need to lean about Hugo

- How to setup the font to look great in English and fall
  back to system fonts for Japanese.
- How to setup mathjax?
- What are shortcodes and how can they make my life easier?
- Should I be using AMP?
- How to render the code that I care about
  - racket
  - lean
  - coq
- How to add posts generated with other tools
