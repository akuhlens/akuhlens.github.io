Lean is dependently typed language and proof assistant which aims to
make proving more productive by assisting users with automatic
tools. It is a long term effort by Leonardo de Moura from Microsoft
research who is famous for his work on the Z3 SMT solver.

Lean is a open source project and programming language that allows you
to prove using principled meta-programming. Lean the programming
language is a dependently typed programming language based off the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions. Lean allows you to program and
prove properties of your program, by using and constructing
semi-automated tools in the lean programming language.

## The Lean Project

The lean project is an open-source effort by Microsoft Research to
bridge the gap between proof-assistants and automated theorem provers.
One can infer that doing so should make proving properties of mathmatics
and complex systems more productive. 

## The Lean Programming Language

The lean programming language is based off of the Calculus of Inductive
Constructions with the addition of inductive types and type classes. 

## Meta-Programming with Lean

Lean allows you to write meta programs which are programs that manipulate
lean programs. This is used as the basis for automating proofs. This style
of metaprogramming is performed by allowing programs to access hooks in the
type-checker and compiler. 

## Unlike other dependently languages

Not always total

## Unlike other proof assistants

## Strengths

## Weaknesses

Doesn't currently offer a means of extracting programs to efficient execution
environment.
