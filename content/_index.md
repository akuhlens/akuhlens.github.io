I am a computer science PhD student at Indiana University
researching programming language theory and implementation.  In
particular I am interested in designing programming languages
that allow programmers to productively write robust and
efficient code.

The chief way that I have pursued this goal is researching
gradually typed programming languages. Gradual languages allow
the flexibility of prototyping in a dynamic typed programming
language, to seamlessly interoperate with the strong
guarantees of statically typed programming languages.  In
theory the strong guarantees of the static type system should
allow us to generate efficient code, but in practice the
overhead of the implementation techniques for gradual typing
have drowned out such gains. My research focuses on fixing
this shortcoming.

If you wish to know more about me, I encourage you to check
