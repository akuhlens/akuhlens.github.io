My current research goal is to show that gradual typing can be
implemented with good runtime and space performance. In particular
statically typed programs in a gradual language should have very
little overhead over the same program in a statically typed with a
similar feature set. Conversely, dynamically typed programs should
have performance on par with dynamically typed programs. To prove this
hypothesis, I am building a prototype ahead of time compiler for a
statically typed programming language.

## Current Work

My work this week has been focused on coming up with an idea of how
recursive types could be implemented with coercions. From a language
design standpoint I have chosen the recursive type to be
equi-recursive. This means that a Î¼ node and it's unfolding are
definitionally equal (anywhere one is valid so is the other). I think
in the future we will want to compile this to a iso-recursive
intermediate language, because by doing so we may be able to apply
recursive coercions lazily.

So far I have an interpreter that works for the benchmark that I would
like to compile. This includes the rules necessary for converting type
based casts into coercions, applying coercions, and composing
coercions to make them space efficient. More on that
later. Formalization and proofs will come soon. 

I also recently started porting our compiler to have an LLVM backend
by using the Sham library a friend of mine is writing. This should
eventually support tail-call optimization which means we can show
how to introduce low-overhead space-efficient tail-call casts. More
on this later.
