      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my continued struggle to improve myself
I have decided to sign up for a coaching program
that the Kelley School of Business funds. I met with
my coach for the first time last night, and many of
the things we talked about were challenging. Hopefully
this document helps me stay on track with my goals for
the day and can serve as a starting place for the rest
of the week.

and starting new financial goals.

      <title>A Summary of my February</title>

      <description>This last month was really hard. I got a paper rejected from a PLDI after getting really good reviews; My grandfather (fondly referred to as old man) passed on after spending the last 3 months of his life trapped in a nursing home; and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the internship that I applied for. Despite, all of this the last month has made me really hopeful. I have successfully lost 12ish pounds this year, maintained a reasonable exercise routine, taken over the majority of the cooking/shopping from my wife, and how found the energy to decide that I want to learn Japanese despite the fact that I really don&amp;rsquo;t have the time.</description>

      <title>First Research Log</title>

      <description>My current research goal is to show that gradual typing can be implemented with good runtime and space performance. In particular statically typed programs in a gradual language should have very little overhead over the same program in a statically typed with a similar feature set. Conversely, dynamically typed programs should have performance on par with dynamically typed programs. To prove this hypothesis, I am building a prototype ahead of time compiler for a statically typed programming language.</description>
